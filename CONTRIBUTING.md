Thanks for considering Sidewinder and welcome to the world of speed.

I believe in simplicity, so let's keep this guide as simple as we can.

How to Contribute?
1. Create an issue, make sure to document what you are trying to solve i.e. feature or bug. Make sure to mark it with correct label.
Don't forget to include the following in the issue description:
* Feature / Bug Name
* Summary
* Description / Design if applicable

2. Fork the project and code your fix with unit tests; all new features must be coded on the development branch
3. Create a pull request again development branch; checkout a [sample pull request](https://github.com/srotya/sidewinder/pull/22)
4. Pull requests must pass existing unit tests to be considered for a merge

Told you it was going to be short and simple!
